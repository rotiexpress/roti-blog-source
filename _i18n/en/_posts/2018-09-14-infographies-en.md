In order to make us known and to communicate with the general public, we asked Matthieu our graphic designer to design some visuals!


###  Summary of our activity in 1 image ###

We wanted a nice picture that summarizes our activity in 6 points in the manner of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map"> mind-map </a>

The exercise is much more difficult than it seems, because contrary to what we could think the less words you have the harder to get to the point.

That's the result! Ideal to send on social networks or to print on a flyer!

###  More specific visuals ###

We also wanted visuals with strong messages to market our solution on specific themes.

We took the option to use an “old fashioned” visual  with nice typos so that there is a real consistency in the messages.

These visuals will be used for social networks and for the advertising campaigns that we plan to launch in September 2018. Perhaps you have already seen them on some websites?

We love the result! so much so that we also made business cards to distribute in the trade shows.

###  The famous "Kakemono" ###

Mandatory accessory of any good startuper, Kakemono literally "hanging object" means in Japan a painting or calligraphy roll intended to be hung on a mast. 

In practice, it is rather the vertical computer graphics that one puts on one's stand when one participates in an event or a show.

###  Other Goodies ###

Because people are "fans" of our logo we have made various goodies out of it! 
* stickers to place on your computer
* magnets that go on fridges or on the white boards in meeting rooms 
* pins to hang on your jacket
* mugs to drink coffee
* Soft fluffy toys in the shape of a roast!
