### 1/ The number of meetings increases ###
The number of meetings per day and week is increasing over time, at first it was exhilarating but for some time it has been out of control, I cannot cope anymore ...
>I was invited to this meeting, I do not know why, but they consult me! Does it mean that my opinion is important?

### 2/ Meetings are getting longer ###
Last Thursday we were efficient, after 20 minutes everything had been decided, but the host kept on talking and we drifted on other topics and had a cup of coffee together.
>I enjoyed spending time with my colleagues, but couldn't we let people go once important decisions have been made?

### 3/ Finding a meeting room has become a struggle ###
The meeting rooms are always occupied and you have to book them a week in advance.
>We are currently testing an application to optimize the booking since it's become so complicated, but is this really the core of the matter?

### 4/ The diaries are only meetings ###
Our diaries are full of meetings from Monday 8am to Friday 6pm, you now need to set up a 3 people meeting 15 days in advance to.
>We are never at our desks because we spend most of our time meeting. When will we get the real work done?

### 5/ Participants do something else during the meeting ###
As I have meetings all the time I have to find some time to handle the daily work and answer my e-mails. So I always take my laptop and my phone to be multi-task.
>The other day a colleague was eating his sandwich during the meeting, he validated everything we said but did he really listen?

### 6/ We "reassure ourselves" with a lot of meetings ###
The other day I participated in a meeting that lasted 1 hour and we collectively decided on a totally unimportant matter .. I understood after that it was better to decide all together.
> The organizer prefered gathering 7 people to get an "amen" instead of deciding alone .. Did this meeting take place at the expense of deep thinking?

### 7/ The agenda is non-existent ###
Sometimes the meeting is not prepared at all and we simply meet to talk about a topic. The talks are certainly very interesting but we do not understand where we are going.
>The notion of purpose or agenda is totally absent. Why not explain before to people the reason they are gathered?

### 8/ We start and finish systematically late ###
The guests have a lot of trouble being on time, they always have good reasons: "we were looking for the room, we got caught in something else ..." and then there are so many topics to deal with that we rarely get everything done!
> Respecting the time of others is the first of the courtesies! Why not impose punctuality and designate a "timekeeper"?

### 9/ No post-meeting action plan ###
We decided a lot of things which represents a great step forward but it's not really clear on "Who should do what and when?"
>It's obvious that at the next meeting nothing will have progressed .. Why don't we make a todo-list?

### 10/ Some people do not open their mouths ###
We sometimes see people in meetings who do not say a word, they were invited "for info" to listen to what is said and to be kept informed.
>The casting is obviously wrong, why inflict that upon them? Why not just send them the report?

### 11/ Speaking time is monopolized ###
Friday meeting with the manager is always the same ; on the scheduled time he talks for 50 minutes of soporific figures and we must fight to say a word for the remaining 10 minutes!
>What if we tried letting everyone present speak, just to see. Why not organize a distribution of speaking time?

### 12/ It's difficult to suggest any improvement ###
We often have lots of good ideas for doing better next time, but it's hard to get things moving in a context where meeting has become a lifestyle.
>You probably are not the only one thinking that, and you probably have the solution. Why not organize an evaluation of the meeting to collect feedback, a <a href="https://roti.express">ROTI</a> for example?
