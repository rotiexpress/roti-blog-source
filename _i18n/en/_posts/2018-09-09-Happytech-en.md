Since its creation in 2017 we've been members of theHappyTech community, let's go back this story.

###  What is HappyTech? ###

The concept of well-being at work is becoming increasingly important in companies and is a factor of productivity and performance.

> HappyTech: "Technology at the service of well-being at work"

This is the basic idea that drove the HappyTech communal to form, bringing together start-ups, business leaders and investors who work on a daily basis "to make the company a place where everyone can flourish and grow.

Today HappyTech is: 34 member startups, more than 300 press articles, and for the staff :33 volunteers and 1 permanent worker.

The idea has made its way and several branches of HappyTech have opened in Europe, North America and even Australia! The new entities are federated under the International Committee of Happy Tech

###  What are we doing there? ###

At Roti.express we are convinced that well-being at work is not just about putting a table football in the cafeteria!

As a matter of fact, opening this bottom-top communication channel (from the bottom of the pyramid upwards in the hierarchy) has extremely beneficial effects, speech is free, axis of improvement emerge, and as it is, it is often from below that good ideas come.

>Listening actively to one's employees is to take a first step towards their well-being.

Improving meetings, workshops or any other group activities means increasing productivity, which is not decorrelated from well-being because it gives meaning to the events in which one invests time.

>"I feel good when I come out of an effective meeting, I come home at night with a sense of satisfaction"

Beyond providing a simple feedback platform we want to believe that we help change mentalities in business.

###  And concretely what is happening at HappyTech? ###

It is above all an ecosystem: the members talk to each others regularly during the monthly event "Monthly Happy" to discuss our respective progress, and listen each-others pitching and to give advice, exchange business cards and sometimes customer leads.

This allows startups to gain visibility, as an exampleÂ , by participating in webinars or #MondayMotivation videos relayed on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/happytech/">social networks</a>

HappyTech also regularly organizes events in major companies to which member startups are invited, this is the opportunity to pitch in a small committee before a company that has shortlisted the startups it wants to meet.

The communal is also present at important events such as VivaTech, LePoint conference or the Trophies of Well-being, in short we see them everywhere!

On its website Happytech also offers a <a href="https://france.happytech.life/membres/">catalog</a> where the solutions of the members are presented.
