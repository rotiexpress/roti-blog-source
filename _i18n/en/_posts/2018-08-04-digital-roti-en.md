## Digitalising the practice ##

September 2017, we embark on the coding of our application, the objective is announced: we will make ROTI in digital version!â€¨

We start by asking ourselves about the specifications: what is a ROTI ritual?

### Anatomy of the ROTI ritual? ? ###

R.O.T.I. for "Return on Time Invested" is an agile, quick and easy method to evaluate time spent in meetings, workshops or conferences and collect / give feedback.

> The announced goal is to make these events more productive and satisfying for each participant.

After the intervention, each participant gives a mark on a scale from 1 to 5 by a show of hands.

And, in 30 seconds, they explain their rating to the host with a useful and benevolent comment.

### Let's digitalize ###

Let's start with the survey by a show of hands! In order to allow the participants to evaluate the time they have just spent in a meeting, we will propose them to give a number of stars:

And for the under 30 seconds comment? It's quite simple too, we start on a text field that is voluntarily limited to 1000 characters because we do not want the participants to tell us a long story, just to give us hints at improvement to do better next time!

### Let's add value ###

The ROTI ritual is supposed to last 5 minutes, but in reality it is difficult for the host to take the evaluations and write down the comments, but for us it's a piece of cake!

And then we can also group all this on a beautiful page that summarizes the comments!

### One idea leading to another... ###

We have reached our goal of a digitized ritual, we do as much or even more than what was expected

We also realize that when we collect data, it opens the way for us to explore its analytical possibilities. Track the surveys of the different teams, measure progress over time, offer a company level vision! Everything is now possible!
