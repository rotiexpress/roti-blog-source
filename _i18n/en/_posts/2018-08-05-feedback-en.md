###  \fid.bak\ ###

Let's go back for a moment to the concept of feedback.

 Feedback is something that happens in people's minds after watching something (a meeting, a movie, a presentation, etc.) and very often, and unfortunately, it is not expressed in words

###  Self evaluation ###

During a performance, it is very difficult to self-evaluate, unless you record yourself .. and yet!

It is nevertheless a very precious element, moreover it is a natural thing to ask the question to others around you.
> For example after making a presentation the first thing I invariably do when I leave the room is to ask Guillaume: So how was I? did you like it? what did you think?

To ask for feedback is to benefit from other people's points of view, and what interests us there is constructive criticism because it enables us to progress, to improve and to grow.

Every human being is different and will have their own perception and feedback, if we strive to harvest a maximum of them we will obtain an objective opinion.

###  Sharing one's feedback, a story of benevolence? ###

Feedback is something I can choose to give or keep for myself.

 I notice that my competitor who is about to present his product after me has a beautiful piece of lettuce stuck between his teeth: I choose not to give him my feedback!

Michel, the building safety officer, has just given me a hour and half lecture on fire safety and the operation of foam fire extinguishers: I choose to give him my feedback! Look Michel it was very good but my feeling is that it was too long, you lost everyone in the first half hour, wouldn't 45 minutes be sufficient enough? a practical exercise? a video maybe?


###  Mindset ###

There is also a matter of mindset behind all this: am I ready to hear feedback from a third party? Am I ready to hear a criticism that will allow me to improve?

The good news is that most people want to improve and for them this reflex is natural.

There are however exceptions ; people a little infatuated with themselves? tyrannical managers? who could tell me "I know what I'm doing and I have no advice to receive from you!" and it's a shame because I wanted to tell you that you had a piece of salad between your teeth.

In her book [Mindset](https://www.amazon.fr/Mindset-How-Fulfil-Your-Potential/dp/1780332009), which I recommend, Carol Dweck explains in detail the difference between a *fixed mindset* and a *growth mindset*.


###  SCRUM retrospective ###
Let's take a closer look at what SCRUM offers and in particular the Retrospective ritual, what is the purpose of a retrospective? 

The retrospective is a ritual (a meeting) at the end of each sprint (iteration) during which the Scrum team accounts for its experience on the past sprint.

It is therefore a moment of sharing in which each member of the team is asked to give their feedback in an open and transparent way! What are the successes? What are the failures? What could be done better in the next sprint?

> By doing a retrospective we provoke a feedback

The goal for the team is to improve their organization in order to be more efficient, the retrospective is a key element of the principle of continuous improvement and enables the team to become self-learning.
