Agile En Seine 2018 was Tuesday, September 25th! <br><br> 550 participants and 28 talks on the topic of Agile in business, making it one of the major conferences of the French Agile ecosystem.

###  Feedbacks ! (in real time please)###

More than 430 feedbacks were received, thanks to our Roti.express platform, which measured the satisfaction rate of the sessions.

We were here all day long, and observed in real time the feedbacks on the arriving on the platform. At the exit of the rooms the speakers came to us to get a preview of their “scores”!

The average score was 4.12/5, with an outstanding score of 4.91/5 for the inspiring talk of Virginie Guyot.

These feedbacks were shared with the speakers and participants in a mindset of continuous improvement.

###  Why did it work pretty well? ###


Taking feedback is always a tricky moment and can be really time-consuming, both for capture and analysis if it is poorly done.

1. We announced that this will take place at the Keynote session and we quickly explained the rules of the game.

2. To answer: no app to download, no tedious registration (login/password). I flash, I answer, and that's it!

4. We did not force anyone to answer! And we were clear: "it's not your data that interests us but your feedback on the event".

5. We explained that the final results would be shared with everyone. Besides, we were already ready before the end of the event!

6. Taking feeback with the ROTI method (in Agile mode) was very suitable for this event!

###  Capturing feedback during an event?###

We asked the speakers to put a giant QR-Code on the last slide of their Powerpoint presentation

And for those who did not have time to flash the code we made posters in A3 format for each of the sessions, we put them on the doors of each conference room.

We plastered a "QR-Code Wall" in the corridor that connects the different rooms!
