###  1. Begin by lying to the respondents ###

So start with a sentence like "This survey will not take you more than 3 minutes" while you know it won't, but as you want to have a maximum of answers you think it's a good idea.
> Consequence: You have a very good chance to fool people and they'llbelieve you ... this time anyway!

###  2. Ask a lot of questions ###

You want to gather as much information as possible, and you think that this survey is an opportunity to put a maximum of questions to collect as much data as possible!
> Consequence: at question 2 (text field, mandatory, min 50 words) you have already lost 80% of your audience

###  3. Offer a horrible UX (User Experience)  ###

A survey is something disposable, no one remembers it, so why bother doing something enjoyable to use?
> Consequence: in addition to being endless, the interface is unpleasant or even bugged and the questions are inaccurate .. Congratulations! you lose more than 50% of your audience again

###  4. Do not share the results ###

The results belong to you, and you intend to make the numbers say what you want in order to receive a premium and to please your manager.
> Consequence: zero transparency, the survivors of your audience have just spent 25 minutes answering a questionnaire of which they will never see the result and on top of that the results are tampered .. There for sure, you have reached the summits!


###  5. Institute the bashing culture  ###

Because a survey is an opportunity to let off steam and empty one's bag, do not close your questions and if possible make them mandatory.
> Consequence: your survey's a means of blowing off steam, there are no interesting information to draw, no hints at improvement, only the dissatisfaction of those you force to respond.

###  It's simple, and damn effective! ###
<br>
The ROTI survey is composed of  **2 questions**, always the same! and oriented only on **1 évènement** at a time.

The responding time is estimated at only  **30 secondes** seulement (no more).

We offer a **great UX** that works on computer, tablet, mobile without installing an app or even creating login / password.

By default the **sharing of answers** is activated, and we propose to generate a sharing link to diffuse more widely in full **transparency**

We convey a culture of **constructive feedback** that is the essence of our product.
